    "Each has a *corresponding method* that can be used to log events at that level of severity.\n",

    "* `LogRecord`: Loggers automatically create `LogRecord` objects that have **all the information related to the event being logged**, like the name of the logger, the function, the line number, the message, and more.\n",

Handler is a base for subclasses like `StreamHandler`, `FileHandler`, `SMTPHandler`, `HTTPHandler`, and more. These subclasses send the logging outputs to corresponding destinations, like `sys.stdout` or a disk file.\n",
    "* `Formatter`: This is where you specify the format of the output by specifying a string format that lists out the attributes that the output should contain.\n",
