    "\n",
    "Permutation feature importance is a model inspection technique that can be used for **any fitted estimator** when the *data is tabular*. This is especially useful for *non-linear or opaque estimators*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The permutation feature importance is defined to be:\n",
    "> the decrease in a model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This procedure **breaks the relationship between the feature and the target**, thus the drop in the model score is indicative of **how much the model depends on the feature**.\n",
    "* This technique benefits from being model agnostic and can be calculated many times with different permutations of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `permutation_importance` *function* calculates the feature importance of *estimators* for a given *dataset*. The `n_repeats` parameter sets the number of times a feature is randomly shuffled and returns *a sample of feature importances*.\n",
