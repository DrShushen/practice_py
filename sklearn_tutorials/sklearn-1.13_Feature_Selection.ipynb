    "\n",
    "**Sequential Feature Selection** (SFS) is available in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` transformer. SFS can be either **forward** or **backward**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward-SFS** is a greedy procedure that iteratively finds the best new feature to add to the set of selected features. Concretely: \n",
    "* We initially start with zero feature and find the one feature that *maximizes a cross-validated score* when an estimator is trained on this single feature. \n",
    "* Once that first feature is selected, we repeat the procedure by adding a new feature to the set of selected features. \n",
    "* The procedure stops when the desired number of selected features is reached, as determined by the `n_features_to_select` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward-SFS** follows the same idea but works in the opposite direction: instead of starting with no feature and greedily adding features, we start with *all* the features and greedily *remove* features from the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è The `direction` parameter controls whether forward or backward SFS is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, forward and backward selection *do not yield equivalent results*. Also, one may be much faster than the other depending on the requested number of selected features: if we have 10 features and ask for 7 selected features, forward selection would need to perform 7 iterations while backward selection would only need to perform 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è SFS differs from `RFE` and `SelectFromModel` in that **it does not require the underlying model to expose a `coef_` or `feature_importances_` attribute**. It may however be **slower** considering that more models need to be evaluated, compared to the other approaches. For example in backward selection, the iteration going from `m` features to `m - 1` features using k-fold cross-validation requires fitting `m * k` models, while `RFE` would require only a single fit, and `SelectFromModel` always just does a single fit and requires no iterations.\n",
